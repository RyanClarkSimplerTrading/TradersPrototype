    "overview": "Allison graduated from Stephen F. Austin State University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Theatre. Wanting to make sure she wasn’t going to be a starving artist while pursuing theatre, Allison took up trading options after seeing her father successfully do the same. What started as an experiment with a paper trading account quickly grew into a passion. She decided to pursue trading full-time while investing in personal coaching classes. As a result, Allison was so successful that she made back her investment in her first trade! After that, there was no looking back.\n\n        Fast forward to today, Allison has become an integral part of the Simpler Trading family. With her decade of options trading experience Allison continues to grow as a trader, sharing her knowledge within our community. Her experience in not only trading, but teaching others how to trade, shines through in her videos and blog posts. She has experienced and seen other traders go through the ups and downs of trading. Her goal is to help traders minimize the downs, so their ups can outshine in their account. Allison is able to explain complex trading strategies and chart patterns with ease for both beginners and advanced traders. Her unique view of how to look at Capital Risk, the Chart, and the Option Chain can give any trader a new perspective on investing.\n        \n        For those who have trouble with position sizing, chart reading, or options trading, Allison’s Recycling Risk sessions are a “must watch.” You can often find her participating in the Options Trading Room and the Training Room throughout the market day, or catch her outside of market hours teaching classes and hosting member webinars for the Simpler Community.",

        ],
        "discription": "The Divergent Bar indicator was developed to confirm entering or exiting a trade, or in a more advanced trading strategy, as a confirmation for reversals. Is based on a comparative analysis of higher highs and lower lows. Allison typically uses a 30 minute or higher time frame for trading with this indicator and looks for a follow-through signal by seeing if a higher high or lower low occurs within the next three bars / candles.",
        "use": "\n            The Divergent Bar indicator can help determine the potential move of one (or potentially up to 3) bars into the future. The Divergent Bar Indicator can be used on any time frame. For an intraday style trade, I typically stick with the 30 min or 1 hour time frame for this indicator. Instead of still waiting on more trading data to start printing valid signals on other indicators, the Divergent Bar indicator can start giving you signals the very next day. The Divergent Bar Indicator can be used on any type of bar. I personally use the standard Bar. However, if you prefer the Candlestick Bar, it will work on that as well.\n\n  \n\n            There are two different types: the Bullish and Bearish Divergent Bar. The Divergent Bar indicator gives a clear signal of a Bullish or Bearish Divergent Bar just by a change in the Bar’s color. \n            \n            \n            \n            A Bullish Divergent Bar signals a potential move to a higher high compared to the high of the bar forming the Bullish Divergent Bar. This Higher High typically happens within the next bar, but can take up to 3 bars to follow through on the signal\n            \n            The current price bar needs to meet the following criteria:\n            \n            The current bar needs to have a lower low compared to the prior bar.\n            The current bar’s close needs to be in the top 50% of the current bar’s trading price range.\n            For a Bullish Divergent Bar, sellers had brought the price to create that lower low. However, the buyers end up outweighing the sellers going to the close driving the price back up. This leads to a strong probability that the move up will likely continue to create a higher high than the current bar as buyers continue to jump in.\n            \n            \n            \n            A Bearish Divergent Bar signals a potential move to a lower low compared to the low of the bar forming the Bearish Divergent Bar.This Lower Low typically happens within the next bar, but can take up to 3 bars to follow through on the signal. \n            \n            The current price bar needs to meet the following criteria:\n            \n            The current bar needs to have a higher high compared to the prior bar.\n            The current bar’s close needs to be in the bottom 50% of the current bar’s trading price range.\n            For a Bearish Divergent Bar buyers had brought the price to create that higher high. However, the sellers end up outweighing the buyers going into the close driving the price back down. This leads to a strong probability that the down up will likely continue to create a lower low compared to the current bar as sellers continue to jump out.\n            \n            \n            \n            If a Divergent Bar prints back to back, whether it is a Bearish and Bullish Divergent Bar, or two Bearish and two Bullish Bars, this can start to be an overall sign of consolidation.It does not mean the signal will not follow through, however it might not be as dramatic of a follow through for a higher high or lower lower. If you decided to take a trade off a Divergent Bar during consolidation there are two things you can take into consideration:\n            \n            Risk: You may look to hold a smaller Capital Risk in the trade in case it does not follow through.\n            Price Target: consider taking a smaller price target with a lower GTC. This increases the possibility it will fill and you can still take a quick profit.\n          ",

        "description": "The Compound Breakout Tool is a \"3 in 1 study\". It tracks individual \"component studies\" and indicates when they're in confluence to provide a very strong indication of a possible entry or exit for a trade. Minimum of two of three components aligned is recommended.",
        "use": "\n          The Compound Breakout Tool is comprised of 3 separate studies:\n\n          The Stochastics\n          The MACDHistogram\n          Several Simple Moving Averages\n           \n          \n          The Compound Breakout Tool consists of three different lines, tracking the three different studies: When a signal first starts to print it will show up as a green (rising) or red (declining) box. \n          \n           \n          \n          After printing the square,  it will continue to print a dot for each bar the signal is still valid. When looking at this indicator the perfect setup is when you have all three rows in line with each other printing the same color signal. This can easily be confirmed by the Triangle printed at the top or bottom. Sometimes waiting for all three signals to print in line, may take some time, or may never happen. This is why when two signals are in line, it can be the start of the set up and still a valid entry (however less conservative or one when compared to all three printing). \n          \n           \n          \n          This tool can easily be identified by a colored dot printing top or bottom. The dots will continue to print until all three signals print in line, or until one stops printing/gets interrupted by the opposite signal. Not only is this indicator good at identifying a trend, but it can also help in determining consolidation or sideways movement. If there are a lot of green and red boxes printing back to back this can indicate the price is consolidating before it determines which trend direction it wants to move in next. Sometimes when this starts to occur and squeeze will begin printing at the same time.\n          ",
